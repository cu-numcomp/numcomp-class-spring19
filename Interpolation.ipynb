    "\n",
    "Interpolation and regression address the problem of approximating functions using their (possibly noisy) values at a finite set of points.  There is usually an underlying process from which the observed data are obtained, but this process is impractical to evaluate every time a function value is needed.  Examples of underlying processes include:\n",

    "\n",
    "We would like an inexpensive deterministic surrogate that we can use instead.  The most common surrogate functions are polynomials and rational functions (ratios of polynomials) because they are convenient to compute with.  Other choices are often made when there is prior knowledge about the behavior of the system, such as using\n",

    "\n",
    "If we are given an arbitrary distribution of points, interpolation with a single polynomial is not robust.  Piecewise constant interpolation is not very accurate and gives a rough function.\n",
    "We could improve the accuracy by using a piecewise linear function (see homework 2-Interpolation), but the accuracy is still limited and the function still isn't smooth (there is a \"corner\" where the slope changes at each data point).\n",
    "Splines are a way to guarantee an arbitrary amount of smoothness.\n",
    "The idea is that given sorted input points $\\{x_i\\}_{i=0}^n$, we compute an interpolating polynomial $s_i(x)$ on every interval $(x_i, x_{i+1})$.\n",

    "#### Interpolation\n",
    "Given a function value $y_i$ at each $x_i$, we require\n",

    "so that the polynomial interpolates our data.\n",
    "If the polynomial has order greater than 1, we are left with some extra degrees of freedom.\n",

Meanwhile, there are only $n-1$ internal nodes.  If we impose continuity of the first derivative, we have $n - (n-1) = 1$ undetermined degrees of freedom.  We could fix this by imposing a boundary condition, such as that the slope at one end-point (e.g., $s_0'(x_0)$) was equal to a known value.  This is not symmetric and is often an unnatural condition.\n",

If we impose continuity of the first and second derivatives, we have $2n - 2(n-1) = 2$ remaining degrees of freedom.

This also decouples the tridiagonal system.  Such methods produce [Bezier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve), which are used for many applications including fonts.\n",
    "* [B-splines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline) are a more computationally convenient representation of a piecewise polynomial curve, but are not inherently *interpolatory*.  They are *local* in the sense that modifying control points has only local effects.\n",
    "* [NURBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline) (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are an extension of B-splines to use rational functions.  This allows exact representation of conic sections.  NURBS are used heavily for Computer Aided Design (CAD) and other engineering applications."
