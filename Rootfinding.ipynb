    "\n",
    "Rootfinding is the process of solving $$f(x) = 0$$ for $x$.  The standard assumption is that $f : R \\to R$ is _continuous_.  We are interested in developing general-purpose algorithms---those that can use $f(x)$ as a black box without needing to look inside.  When we implement our rootfinding algorithm in software, the user will pass a function or program to compute $f(x)$.  Rootfinding methods for differentiable functions may also use the derivative $f'(x)$.\n",

For analysis, it is convenient to define the errors $e_i = x_i - x_*$. We say that an algorithm is **$q$-linearly convergent** if $$\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |e_{i+1}| / |e_i| = \\rho < 1.$$  (The $q$ is for \"quotient\".)
